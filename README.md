# Project1-3300

- Do not add script tags to the html.
- The circle should go inside the div with id="circle".
- The histogram is already there, there is no need for another one
- I have cleaned the json file (check).
- If you need to do some styling use the _theme.scss file inside the sass folder. Add your styling at the bottom of the page.
- Please do not touch the html/css because I am getting a lot of errors that were not there before. Let me know if you have any problems.
-  Please post your work on github so that we know what you are working on and can help each other.
-  READ the emails that I am sending.
